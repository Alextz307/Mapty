# Mapty
Implemented **web application** functionality for **workout tracking** using **JavaScript** (the application's design was created by a [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) instructor). Incorporated the **Leaflet third-party library** to render an interactive map and integrated the **geolocation API** to fetch user location data.
